              "Vijay's son, Jason Sanjay, made a cameo appearance with his father in Vettaikaaran (2009) and his daughter portrayed a small role as her father's pre-teen daughter in the climax of Theri (2016). On 5 February 2020, the Income Tax Department raided Vijay's residence in Chennai and inquired about potential tax evasion, making note of his investment in immovable properties, which he inherited from the production studio AGS Entertainment. Opponents of the Bharatiya Janata Party accused them of politically targeting Vijay through such raids because he was critical of them on demonetization and the Goods and Services Tax (India) in the film Mersal. On 13 July 2021, the Madras High Court dismissed a writ petition filed by Vijay in 2012 seeking exemption of the Entry Tax for his Rolls-Royce Ghost car that was imported from England. On 15 July 2022, the court declared that no fine should be imposed on the car imported since he had paid the full entry tax before January 2019, closing out the case in the process."
